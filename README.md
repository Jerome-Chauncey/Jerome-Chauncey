# Hi there, I'm Jerome! 👋


## Financial Markets Analyst | Agripreneur | Cross-Border Tech Project Leader

### Who Am I?
My journey has been a blend of finance, technology, and hands-on entrepreneurship. I started in financial markets trading, where I learned to navigate complex systems, manage risk, and make data-driven decisions. Over time, I took on leadership roles in project management, overseeing teams and ensuring operations ran efficiently. But my curiosity didn’t stop there. I transitioned into sustainable agriculture, applying my analytical mindset to innovative farming ventures. This shift wasn’t just about business, it was about growth, adaptability, and building something from the ground up. Whether in trading, project leadership, or farming, I thrive in environments that challenge me to think strategically and drive real impact.

## 💹 Financial Markets
Since 2020, I have been actively trading global financial markets using the **No Trade Zone strategy**—a breakout approach that integrates news fundamentals with a strict set of rules. Developed during the COVID-19 pandemic, this method prioritizes low risk and high reward, ensuring calculated entries with minimal exposure. With disciplined risk management, I consistently achieve **13%+ profits over a three-month period**, making it a reliable and sustainable trading strategy. Continuously refining my technical and fundamental analysis skills, I adapt to market volatility to maintain long-term success.

## 📊 Research Assistant
Promoted from **Data Collection Specialist to Team Supervisor**, leading a large team in traffic count projects and ensuring accurate data entry. Spearheaded **cross-border research in Malaba (Kenya-Uganda Border)** for the Regional Electronic Cargo Driver Tracking System (RECDTS), a contactless solution that:
- Reduced COVID-19 transmission risks by digitizing cargo/driver tracking.
- Streamlined border operations, enhancing efficiency for stakeholders.

## 🍄 Ventured into Mushroom Cultivation
I ventured into **mushroom farming in August 2023**, starting with a hands-on training course and an online course through Alison to deepen my understanding. I meticulously researched and designed schematics for an outdoor grow tent, ensuring optimal conditions for mushroom cultivation. With the support of friends and family, I brought my vision to life and am now reaping the rewards of my hard work. Despite my success, I remain committed to research and development, continuously refining my techniques for even better yields.
